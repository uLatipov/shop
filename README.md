# Foreword

So, I am planning to build an online shop of some kind of shop that operates offline
I wanna keep it simple for now.
Backend is going to be REST API written in typescipt, and also planning to write the frontend part in ReactJs using Typescript.
Aim of the project is to get to practice coding after a long time, so I am making myself a challenge to write a somewhat functional app in Typescipt.
first, I am gonna start with backend. First step on building a backend server, I think is to know what exactly I want it to be like, so below I am gonna make a list of bare-minimum functionality of the shop.

## Homepage

### Dynamic Editable list of products shown in homepage:

1. Id: Product
2. Image with fixed size with aspect ration of 16:10

### Catalog/Search

So I came to conclusion, that catalog is the same as searching

1. Search by name
2. Search by manufacturer
3. Search by category (processors, fans, power supplies, monitors)
4. Search manufacturers products by categories
5. Sort: 1. Lowest and highest price 2. In the range of price specified by user 3. Amount of sales 4. Rating 5. On Sale 6. Manufacturer
